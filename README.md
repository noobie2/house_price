# house_price
This uses sample generated data and uses first OLS regression to predict housing prices.
The R^2 score is around 80% and the error is well within the leeway.

Then i also used LinReg from sklearn library, and that produced more error prone predictions, with cross_validation_score of 0.77.
All basic assumptions about the data have been checked.
